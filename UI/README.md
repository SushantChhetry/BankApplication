# BankApplication

Task:

Create a command line interface that allows users to:

1. Login totheir acount
  - set up 2 or 3 test users (username, password, balance)
2. Users should see a menu once logged in allowing them to:
  - View Balance
  - Deposit Money
  - Withdraw Money
  - Transfer Money 
3. I expect this to be stage 1, next consider how to improve the app
